	Digilines allows luacontrollers to talk to each other over a bus interface, just like what I&sup2;C, SPI or RS232 does for real microcontrollers. It also adds some additional features such as getting the accurate time of day with a real time clock, getting the light level using a light sensor and displaying text on an LCD screen. Have a look at the <a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=5263">minetest forum post</a> for more information or download it from the <a href="https://github.com/Jeija/minetest-mod-digilines">GitHub page</a>.<br/><br/>
